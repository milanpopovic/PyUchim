        <p>PyUchim (previously WebStudio) was created in 2015 as a tool for teaching Python programming, especially to beginners.</p>
	<p>A driving goal is to be very easy to use. Some of its main advantages for teaching are:
    	  <ul>
    	    <li>students do not need to install any software,</li>
    	    <li>students will all have the same Python version and the same editor, and</li>
    	    <li>students can access the same programming environment and code files from any computer.</li>
    	    <li>teachers can easyly access student's homeworks and leave comments, using Mentor options.</li>
            <li>students and teachers can collaborate by sharing code editor and talking via Skype.</li> 
          </ul>
	</p>
	<p>PyUchim is used in teaching "Programming Fundamentals" at Faculty for Management, Economy and Finance, Belgrade.</p>	
        <p>PyUchim is based on <a href="https://py3.codeskulptor.org" target="_new">CodeSkulptor3.</a> More information on CodeSkulptor3 capabalities may be found in <a href="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/docs.html"
